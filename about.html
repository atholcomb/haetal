    <h1>Who am I?</h1>

    <p>My name is Andrew Holcomb. I am the creator of this blog and specifically write code in Python. I decided to explore BigO Notation as it became a requirement for coding interviews and challenges that I faced with algorithms while testing code that I wrote.</p>

    <p>I have been writing Python code for the last 15 or so years, but have always felt that measuring and being able to understand Algorithms and Data Structures, specifically apart of Computer Science curriculum was something that I did not have a chance to study.</p>

    <p>It was only in my latter stages of writing code and specifically encountering interviews that I realized how important BigO Notation would be. Mathmathically, I find BigO Notation to be a very beautiful and an elegant way of expressing algorithmic efficiency and decided to take it upon myself to study it so I could write more efficient code.</p>

    <p>Through the years, I have written (to date) over 194 <a href="https://github.com/atholcomb/code_challenges/tree/main/pycodechallenges">Python challenges</a>. Each one, building upon a former challenge which gave me a better grasp of how to write code more efficently as I went along.</p>

    <p>Every challenge I have faced with writing Python code has dealt with realizing that code is just a simple set of instructions that ultimately provides a way for a computer to understand how we (as humans) wish to view or work with computers in our everyday world. This understanding made me realize that code is a very natural way to work in the world of today and I learned to become obessed with it as I grew.</p>

    <p>In all the time I have spent writing code, I have come away knowing that Python has given me a tool that I can use in my everyday tasks that make more logical, sound, and critical of how my mind views the world and yet also provides me a way of being creative. Specifically, writing code that is both useful and functional, make me feel happy and allow me to express to the community how much Python means to me.</p>
